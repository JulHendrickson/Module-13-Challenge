# Module-13-Challenge
Module 13 Challenge of FinTech Bootcamp

For this challenge, I coded a Jupyter notebook in Google Colab that creates a binary classification model using deep neural networks.

The goal was to take a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup (fictitious company) over the years and predict which applicants would ultimately become successful.

## High-Level Steps

### 1 Preprocess data for a neural network model.
### 2 Compile and evaluate a binary classification model.
### 3 Optimize the model.

## Files 
The Starter_Code folder contains a Resources folder and two Jupyter notebooks. The Jupyter notebook named Colab_venture_funding_with_deep_learning is the one used to complete this challenge.

The Resources folder contains the applicants_data.csv file which has the data provided to build the neural network and three HDF5 files. AlphabetSoup.h5 is the original binary classification model built. AlphabetSoup_A1.h5 is the first alternate model and AlphabetSoup_A2.h5 is the second alternate model. These alternate models were attempting to optimize and improve on the original.
